Any changes or updates to the data inside these Nodes will be heard by the Node and this can drive event chains that update many interdependent values and their graphical representations immediately.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"For more examples of what Makie can do, visit the documentation at https://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/","category":"page"},{"location":"#Setup","page":"Home","title":"Setup","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"# in the REPL\n]add BioMakie\n\n# elsewhere\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"BioMakie\")\n\n# import the package\nusing BioMakie","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"API/#API","page":"API","title":"API","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"API/","page":"API","title":"API","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"API/","page":"API","title":"API","text":"Modules = [BioMakie]","category":"page"},{"location":"API/#BioMakie.MSAView","page":"API","title":"BioMakie.MSAView","text":"MSAView is an object/container to hold relevant data for convenience.\n\nFields:\n\tmsa\t\t\t\t- The multiple sequence alignment\n\tannotations\t\t- Labels and metadata\n\tmatrix\t\t\t- The matrix of the alignment\n\tscenes\t\t\t- Holds 2 scenes: scene[1] is everything, scene[2] is the main scene\n\tlayout\t\t\t- The Makie Layout containing these scenes and controls\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"API/#BioMakie.StructureView","page":"API","title":"BioMakie.StructureView","text":"StructureView is an object/container to hold relevant data for convenience.\n\nFields:\n\tprotein\t\t\t- The protein structure\n\tmodels\t\t\t- Structure models\n\tchains\t\t\t- Structure chains\n\tresidues\t\t- Structure residues\n\tatoms\t\t\t- Structure atoms\n\tscenes\t\t\t- Holds 2 scenes: scene[1] is everything, scene[2] is the main scene\n\tlayout\t\t\t- The Makie Layout containing these scenes and controls\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"API/#BioMakie.msaview-Tuple{String}","page":"API","title":"BioMakie.msaview","text":"msaview(str::String; kwargs...)\n\nReturn an MSAView object with Pfam ID \"str\".\n\nOptional Arguments:\n\nfiletype ()  \t\t   - Type of file to retrieve, default Stockholm\naligntype ()  \t   - Type of alignment to retrieve, default \"full\"\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"API/#BioMakie.structureview-Tuple{String}","page":"API","title":"BioMakie.structureview","text":"structureview(str::String; kwargs...)\n\nReturn a StructureView object with PDB ID \"str\".\n\nOptional Arguments:\n\ndir (String)         - Directory for PDB structure, default \"\"\nshowbonds (Boolean)  - To display bonds, default true\ncolors (String)      - Color set for atoms, default \"element\"\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"API/#BioMakie.viewmsa-Tuple{String}","page":"API","title":"BioMakie.viewmsa","text":"viewmsa(str::String; kwargs...)\n\nVisualize multiple sequence alignment with Pfam ID \"str\".\n\nOptional Arguments:\n\ndir (String)         \t\t- Directory of PDB structure, default \"\"\nwidth (Int)         \t\t- Width for MSA grid, default 40\nheight (Int)        \t\t- Height for MSA grid, default 20\nresolution (Tuple{Int})   - Resolution of the scene, default (1500, 600)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"API/#BioMakie.viewstruc-Tuple{String}","page":"API","title":"BioMakie.viewstruc","text":"viewstruc(str::{String}; kwargs...)\n\nVisualize structure with PDB ID \"str\".\n\nOptional Arguments:\n\ndir (String)         - Directory of PDB structure, default \"../data/PDB\"\nshowbonds (Boolean)  - To display bonds, default true\ncolors (String)      - Color set for atoms, default \"element\"\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"API/#BioMakie.viewstrucs-Tuple{AbstractArray{String,N} where N}","page":"API","title":"BioMakie.viewstrucs","text":"viewstrucs(strs::AbstractArray{String}; kwargs...)\n\nVisualize all structures in the array strs.\n\nOptional Arguments:\n\ndir (String)         - Directory of PDB structure, default \"\"\nshowbonds (Boolean)  - To display bonds, default true\ncolors (String)      - Color set for atoms, default \"element\"\nresolution (Tuple{Int})   - Resolution of the scene, default (1500, 600)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"}]
